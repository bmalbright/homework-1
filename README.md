# homework-1

 1. Assignment was to edit the html document and corresponding css file to make it more efficient, for lack of a better term. Particular attention was to be given to converting the <div> tags that effectively made up every element into semantic element tags. attention was also to be given to the order of the coding, especially in the css file, to ensure it was laid out in a logical manner that reflected the flow of the document. Comments were also to be added to the document. 

 2.One of the first things I worked on was looking at the HTML. I combined some of the code for the aside panel titled benefits to reduce excess code. There was a group of us on a zoom call figuring that out, so some will have similar coding. I think Alex was leading that call. We changed the corresponding css. 

 3. I also changed all the <div> tags to semantic element tags. 

 4. I had to add an ID reference to the SEO box in the main section so the nav link in the header would pick it up. 

 5. I removed a span element in the header section in html so that I could combine a section in the css. 

 6. I might have tweaked some more html, but I think that was it. Sorry, didn't make nots as I was going along. 

 7. There was some more combining, but the main changes I made in the css was reorganizing it. The page started laying out the style of the three main section boxes, and then had all of the aside section styling, before finishing the three main section boxes. I moved the styling for the aside section to underneath the three main section boxes so that the css page reads down the page, and left to right. 

 8. Comments were added to the html and css pages.
